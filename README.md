TodoTickie is a lightweight VS Code extension that allows users to add tasks with due dates, view them in a tree view in the Explorer sidebar, and manage a basic todo list persisted across sessions.

3. Select the downloaded file.

## Usage
- Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Add Todo Task".
- Enter task name and due date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- View tasks in the Explorer sidebar under "Todo Tasks".
- Use the refresh icon to update the view.
